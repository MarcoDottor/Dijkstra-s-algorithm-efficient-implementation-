Project for 'Algoritmi e Principi dell'Informatica' 2021 at Politecnico di Milano

The goal of this project is to handle a ranking of 'k' best weighted directed graphs, ranked by their ewight, i.e. how much it costs to reach all nodes of the graph; all this while consuming as little time and space as possible.
